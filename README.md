### 👩🏽‍🎓 I am a sophomore at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill pursuing a double major in computer science and information science with a minor in entrepreneurship.

### 👩🏽‍💻 With a strong passion for technology, I am particularly interested in computer science, cyber security, and cloud computing.

### 🎭 In my free time, I enjoy theatre, music, and literature and keeping up with the latest technological advancements.

### 👩🏽‍🏫 I am committed to inspiring the next generation of STEM professionals, regardless of their background. 

### 📚 To that end, my book, ‘Codi Can Code and You Can Too,’ educates children about available resources and encourages them to pursue a STEM career.

### ⭐️ My ultimate goal is to create a more diverse and inclusive STEM industry.
