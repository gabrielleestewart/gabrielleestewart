### Hello! 👋🏽
- 👩🏽‍🎓 I am a freshman pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Information Science with a minor in Entrepreneurship at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
- 👩🏽‍💻 With a strong passion for technology, I am particularly interested in computer science, cyber security, and cloud computing.
- 🎭 In my free time, I enjoy exploring the world of theatre, music, and literature and keeping up with the latest technological advancements.
- 👩🏽‍🏫 I am committed to inspiring the next generation of STEM professionals, regardless of their background. 
- 📚 To that end, my book, ‘Codi Can Code and You Can Too,’ educates children about available resources and encourages them to pursue a STEM career.
- ⭐️ My ultimate goal is to create a more diverse and inclusive STEM industry.
